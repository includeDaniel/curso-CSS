                In the summer of 1972, at seventeen, Steve left home, against his parents' wishes, to live in a cabin with his first girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan.

                In 1974 he got a job at Atari. The company would serve as a springboard for Jobs to reach Europe and then India, where he would take a spiritual journey

                In 1978 his daughter is born with Chrisann - a girl named Lisa - but he does not take over the child. The case will go to court as Chrisann demands that he take over the baby. He asks for a DNA test, since the couple lived between comings and goings.

                Apple Computer Inc was created in April 1976 to market a personal computer created by Wozniak a few months earlier.

Launched in May 1980, the Apple III was a failure. Randy Wigginton, one of the engineers, summed up the problem: “The Apple III was a kind of baby conceived during an orgy; later, everyone has a terrible headache, and there is that bastard son, and everyone says: it's not mine ”.

                The Apple Lisa was initially conceived as a $ 2,000 machine based on a 16-bit microprocessor, instead of the 8 bits used on the Apple II. The project was born in 1979. It was the first Apple computer to use the graphical interface, based on Xerox Alto technology.

                The Annie project was born in 1979, the result of engineer Jef Raskin's desire to create a simple piece of equipment, with a screen, keyboard and computer in one piece and sold for a thousand dollars.

                On May 24, 1985, at a meeting between Jobs, Sculley and Apple's executive body, they all strongly supported Sculley. With the restructuring planned by Sculley, Jobs would not be in control of any division and no operational charge, but he could remain in the company with the title of chairman of the board and in the role of product visionary. Jobs did not accept. He was now outside Apple.

                In 1996, Apple, which was developing a new operating system, purchased NeXT Computer, from Steve Jobs, in order to use NeXTStep as the basis for its new operating system. With this operation, Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 as a consultant. Apple was, however, in a fragile financial situation and about to close.
